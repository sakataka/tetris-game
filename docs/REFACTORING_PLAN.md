# Tetris Game Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan for the Tetris game codebase, focusing on reducing redundancy, improving extensibility, and maintaining clean, maintainable code.

## Refactoring Categories

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium-Scale Refactoring

#### 2.2 Audio Strategy Initialization Logic Improvement
**Purpose**: Reduce duplicate initialization patterns

**Current Issues**:
- WebAudioStrategy and HTMLAudioStrategy have similar initialization code
- Fallback logic duplicated in AudioManagerV2
- Error handling repeated in each strategy

**Proposed Solution**:
- [ ] Move common initialization to BaseAudioStrategy
- [ ] Abstract fallback mechanism
- [ ] Create initialization lifecycle hooks
- [ ] Implement proper async/await patterns throughout

#### 2.3 Animation Management Optimization
**Purpose**: Improve performance and simplify management

**Current Issues**:
- Complex priority management logic
- FPS limiting code scattered across multiple methods
- Performance monitoring duplicated

**Proposed Solution**:
- [ ] Create AnimationQueue with built-in priority
- [ ] Centralize FPS limiting logic
- [ ] Implement animation pooling for particle effects
- [ ] Add performance budgeting system

### ðŸŸ¢ Small-Scale Refactoring

#### 3.3 Type Definition Consolidation
**Purpose**: Improve type reusability

**Current Issues**:
- Similar toggle action types defined separately
- Update action types duplicated across stores
- Generic patterns not utilized

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Create generic Action types
- [ ] Consolidate Toggle/Update/Set action types
- [ ] Use TypeScript utility types more effectively
- [ ] Create shared store type definitions

#### 3.4 Constant Management Improvement
**Purpose**: Eliminate magic numbers and centralize constants

**Current Issues**:
- Some timeout values hardcoded
- Animation durations scattered
- Related constants in different files

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Move all timing constants to timing.ts
- [ ] Group related constants together
- [ ] Name all magic numbers
- [ ] Create constant documentation

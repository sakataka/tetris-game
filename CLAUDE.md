# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Production-ready cyberpunk-themed Tetris game built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Features comprehensive state management, audio system with fallback strategies, and particle effects.

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15.3.3 + React 19 + TypeScript 5 + Zustand 5 + Tailwind CSS v4

## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 18+, pnpm package manager

**Configuration**: The game uses environment-based configuration with `.env.local` overrides:

```bash
# Key environment variables (see .env.example)
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUDIO_ENABLED=true          # Audio system toggle
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTICLES_ENABLED=true      # Particle effects toggle
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_PARTICLES=200           # Performance tuning
NEXT_PUBLIC_TARGET_FPS=60               # Frame rate target
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LEVEL=1             # Starting difficulty
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_PERFORMANCE=false     # Performance debugging
```

**Development Tools**: Uses Turbopack for fast development, Husky for pre-commit hooks

## Architecture Overview

### Component Architecture (3-Layer Structure)

```
TetrisGame (Entry Point)
â”œâ”€â”€ GameOrchestrator (Lifecycle & SSR)
â”œâ”€â”€ GameLogicController (Business Logic)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Game state management (Zustand)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Audio system integration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Game controls aggregation
â””â”€â”€ GameLayoutManager (UI Layout)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Desktop/Mobile layouts
    â””â”€â”€ Component composition
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Render Props Pattern**: `GameLogicController` provides API via `children(api)`
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Audio system with WebAudio â†’ HTMLAudio â†’ Silent fallback
3. **Service Pattern**: `StatisticsService` for centralized calculations
4. **MVC Pattern**: `BoardRenderer` separates rendering logic from UI

## State Management (Zustand)

### Core Stores

- **gameStateStore**: Game state, piece movement, line clearing
- **settingsStore**: User preferences with localStorage persistence
- **statisticsStore**: High scores and gameplay metrics
- **themeStore**: Theme management with 5 presets + custom colors
- **accessibilityStore**: WCAG-compliant features (3 sub-stores)

### Store Usage Pattern

```typescript
// Individual selectors prevent object regeneration
export const useGameState = () => useGameStateStore((state) => state.gameState);
export const useSetGameState = () =>
  useGameStateStore((state) => state.setGameState);
```

## Key Systems

### Audio System (Strategy Pattern)

- **AudioManagerV2**: Manages strategy switching
- **WebAudioStrategy**: Primary audio with object pooling
- **HTMLAudioStrategy**: Fallback for older browsers
- **SilentStrategy**: Silent mode fallback
- Auto-detection and graceful degradation

### Particle System

- **ParticlePool**: Object pooling with 80%+ reuse rate
- **CanvasRenderer**: Gradient caching, selective clearing
- **FpsController**: Adaptive 30-120fps control
- 200+ particles at 60fps with automatic optimization

### Animation System

- **AnimationManager**: Centralized RAF management
- **useAnimationFrame**: Hook-based animation control
- **useTimerAnimation**: Interval replacement with RAF
- Performance monitoring and auto-optimization

### Logging System

- **Logger**: Environment-aware unified logging with structured context
- **Log Levels**: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG (development only)
- **Game Helpers**: `log.audio()`, `log.animation()`, `log.game()`, `log.performance()`
- **Production Mode**: Automatic debug log suppression for clean console output
- **Structured Context**: Component identification and metadata attachment

## UI Components

### Panel System (Unified Design)

- **PanelBase**: Universal panel component
- 6 themes: cyan, purple, green, yellow, red, default
- Consistent hologram effects and neon borders
- Responsive sizing (sm, md, lg)

### Key Components

- **TetrisBoard**: Game board with BoardRenderer MVC
- **ParticleEffect/Canvas**: Line clear animations
- **VirtualControls**: Mobile touch controls (5 buttons)
- **StatisticsDashboard**: 15 extended metrics

## Hooks Architecture

### Core Game Hooks

- **useGameControls**: Piece movement and rotation logic
- **useGameLoop**: Combines keyboard, timer, and drop logic
- **useGameTimer**: Animation-based timer system
- **useSounds**: Audio management with fallback chain

### System Hooks

- **useHighScoreManager**: Auto-detection on game end
- **useSessionTrackingV2**: Play time and session management
- **useThemeManager**: Dynamic CSS variable updates

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Pure functions (tetrisUtils, statisticsUtils)
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library with JSDOM
- **Integration Tests**: Zustand store testing with mock scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Memory and rendering optimization validation
- **Coverage**: 272 tests, 100% passing with Vitest

```bash
# Run specific test patterns
pnpm test tetris           # Run tests matching "tetris"
pnpm test src/test/hooks   # Run hook tests
pnpm test --ui             # Run with Vitest UI
```

**Test Files Structure**: Located in `src/test/` with corresponding `*.test.ts` files

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Memory Management**

   - Object pooling for particles and audio
   - Selective board rendering (partial updates)
   - useRef for animation state

2. **Rendering Optimization**

   - React.memo on all components
   - Individual Zustand selectors
   - Lazy loading for settings tabs

3. **Animation Performance**
   - Unified RAF management
   - FPS limiting and frame skipping
   - Performance monitoring

## Type Safety

- **Strict TypeScript**: No `any` types, comprehensive interfaces
- **Branded Types**: Type-safe IDs (HighScoreId, ThemeId)
- **Runtime Guards**: 26 validation functions for JSON/API boundaries
- **Event Types**: Strict typing for keyboard and touch events

## Internationalization

- **i18next**: Full EN/JA support
- **Dynamic Loading**: Browser language detection
- **Component Integration**: All UI text internationalized
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and announcements

## Code Quality & Linting

### Oxlint Integration (Rust-based, 50-100x faster)

- **Primary Linter**: Oxlint 1.0 with 500+ rules
- **Performance**: 7-8ms execution time vs ESLint's 1.4s
- **Memory Usage**: 78MB vs ESLint's 416MB (5.3x less)
- **Configuration**: `.oxlintrc.json` with Next.js/React/TypeScript plugins

```bash
pnpm lint         # Oxlint only (daily development)
pnpm lint:oxlint  # Oxlint explicit execution
pnpm lint:eslint  # ESLint only (when needed)
pnpm lint:full    # Both linters (comprehensive check)
pnpm lint:fix     # Auto-fix with both linters
```

### Linting Strategy

- **Development**: Oxlint for instant feedback
- **Pre-commit**: Oxlint via lint-staged (fast commits)
- **CI/CD**: Oxlint in pipeline (faster builds)
- **Comprehensive**: ESLint available when needed

## Important Notes

- Package manager: pnpm (required)
- Comments and commits: English only
- Linting: Oxlint primary, ESLint secondary
- Build before commit: Always run `pnpm build`
- Git hooks: Pre-commit checks via Husky

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Feature

1. Check existing patterns in similar components (follow MVC/hooks architecture)
2. Use appropriate Zustand stores (`gameStateStore`, `settingsStore`, etc.)
3. Follow TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)
4. Add comprehensive tests in `src/test/`
5. Run `pnpm quality:check` before committing

### Debugging Common Issues

**Audio Problems:**

```bash
# Check audio strategy in browser console
log.audio("Current strategy:", audioStrategy.currentStrategy)
# Verify fallback chain: WebAudio â†’ HTMLAudio â†’ Silent
```

**Performance Issues:**

```bash
# Enable performance debugging
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_PERFORMANCE=true pnpm dev
# Check AnimationManager stats in console
log.performance("FPS:", animationManager.getFPS())
```

**State Management Issues:**

- Use Zustand DevTools browser extension
- Check individual selectors to prevent object regeneration
- Verify store subscription patterns

**Build Issues:**

```bash
pnpm build              # Check for build errors
pnpm lint:full          # Comprehensive linting
pnpm tsc --noEmit       # TypeScript validation
```
